### Introduction
- Meeting purpose: assess our work as a team over the warmup period: what went well, opportunities for improvement

### Team Reflections

#### What Went Well
- Everyone did a good job taking on responsibility.
- Great job with well-organized CSS (team effort).
- People were willing to help each other out with different parts of the project.
- Everyone did well using the Git workflow (branches, issues, pull requests) so development went smoothly.

#### Areas to Improve
- Be more mindful of bugs in HTML, JS when testing.
- Make sure to look at the console when writing JS code.
- User documentation: keeping it less technical and considering the average user.
- Planning ahead more so the video wasn’t rushed and better quality.
- Start planning earlier so development doesn’t feel as rushed.
- Getting more feedback on how the team feels about the project to make decisions.
- Incorporating everyone into planning and ideation.

## Notes
- Using AI/LLMs requires good prompting and understanding of why it works and if it’s good quality.
