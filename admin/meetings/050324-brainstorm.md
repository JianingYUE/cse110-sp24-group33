- New entry button on the home screen
- End-of-week summary/analysis
  - Hours spent on a project or task
- Main calendar widget

### Existing Solutions + Inspiration
- Apple Journal Application
    - Like the simple UI, having a new entry button
- Day One
    - Tags for entries
    - Incorporating photos or audio for entries
    - Photos could help track code, PRs

### Project Requirements

- Ability to log tasks (CRUD)
- Ability to track sentiment
- Ability to write and store a reflection
- Visual indication of days with entries
- Aesthetic and intuitive interface

### User Stories + Personas
#### User Stories
-Jake is a 10x developer who wants the perfect efficiency tool to accomplish his many complex tasks. 
- Bob is a CS student who wants to be able to organize his PA deadlines to get a 4.0 
- As someone who works on multiple different projects at once, Mark wants to be able to tag tasks with specific project tags.

#### User Personas
- Jeff is a short-tempered developer who gets yelled at by his boss every day for not working hard enough. He thinks by logging his work and setting timelines, he can get work done more efficiently and impress his boss with proof that he's been working hard.
- Jane is a disorganized developer who struggles to keep track of deadlines and can get easily overwhelmed. She wants a tool that helps her to break down tasks and organize effectively. She values simplicity and efficiency in a tool that won't add to her cognitive load. She also appreciates flexibility in her workflow as her days don't always go as planned.
- Steve is trying to improve his skills as a developer and log his progress on specific tasks over time to see how he is improving in his problem-solving ability. He often struggles to remember what he's worked on and how he accomplished a task. He also wants to keep track of all the bugs he encounters and how he manages to fix them such that he can refer to it in the future.
- Mark oversees many different software projects and it is very difficult to manage various tasks, timelines, and organizations. He wants a tool that allows him to take notes and keep track of various deadlines. He thinks this will help him manage his employees more efficiently.
