## Brand
Our team has decided to use a sunset-style theme and color palette for all of our visual elements. This aesthetic choice is inspired by the “dreamy” and laid-back vibe often associated with Southern California. In terms of specific design elements, we'll incorporate objects of palm trees, waves, which visually reflect beach-like scenery.
